## üí° Investment Philosophy

The IGMP represents the optimal market portfolio that all investors would hold in a perfect world with no constraints. It provides:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- This is for educational/research purposes only
- Not personalized investment advice
- Consider your own risk tolerance and investment objectives
- This "World Portfolio" is a good approximation of the global asset allocation, but it might be interesting to adjust it for constrained buyers that overweight some assets (such as Treasuries) for regulatory reasons so it better represents the efficient portfolio.
